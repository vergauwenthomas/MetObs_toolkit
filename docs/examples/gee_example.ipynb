    "This example is the continuation of the previous example: [Using a Dataset](https://metobs-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/doc_example.html). This example serves as a demonstration on how to get meta-data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, make sure you have **set up a Google developers account and a GEE project**. See [Using Google Earth Engine](https://metobs-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/gee_authentication.html#using-google-earth-engine) for a detailed description of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two classes that facilitate the interaction with GEE and the metobs_toolkit:\n",
    "\n",
    " * `GeeStaticDataset`: This class handles GEE Datasets that do not have a time dimension (static). This class is used to extract GEE dataset values at the location of the station (or buffers around them).\n",
    " * `GeeDynamicDataset`: This class handles GEE Datasets that have a time dimension. This class is used to extract timeseries of GEE dataset values at the stations locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both classes can hold metadata (=Coordinates of the stations), and the Â´GeeDynamicDataset` class can hold timeseries data.\n",

    "In this example, we first demonstrate the `GeeStaticDataset` to extract extra metadata for the stations. Then we demonstrate how to extract timeseries at the station locations using `GeeDynamicDataset`."
