MetObs Toolkit is an open source project to make working with meteorological observations in python easier.


Description
-----------

The MetObs-toolkit is a Python package developed to facilitate the use of non-traditional meteorological observations.
The package provides automated quality control (QC) techniques to identify and
flag erroneous observations, and includes methods to fill data gaps.
Additionally, the package offers tools for analyzing the data, e.g. linkage
with popular land-use datasets is included, trough the use of the Google Earth Engine, such
that microclimate effects can be investigated with the MetObs-toolkit.


The MetObs-toolkit provides a comprehensive framework for scientists to process
raw meteorological data for analysis by making intensive use of the `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
and `GeoPandas <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`_ functionalities.
