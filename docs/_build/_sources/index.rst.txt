MetObs Toolkit is an open source project to make working with meteorological observations in python easier.


Description
-----------

The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in
python easier.  It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely,
providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface
to multiple geometries to shapely.  GeoPandas enables you to easily do
operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database
such as PostGIS.
