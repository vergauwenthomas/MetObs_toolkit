    "Some datasets have irregular time frequencies of the observations. These datasets\n",
    "come with some extra challenges. Here is some information on how to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem that can arise is that most observations are **not present** and\n",
    "that **a lot of missing observations** (and gaps) are introduced. This is because\n",
    "the toolkit assumes that each station has observations at a constant frequency. So the toolkit expects\n",
    "a perfectly regular timestamp series. The toolkit will hence ignore observations\n",
    "that are not on the frequency, so observations get lost. Also, it looks for observations\n",
    "on perfectly regular time intervals, so when a timestamp is not present, it is assumed to be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems you can **synchronize** your observations. Synchronizing will\n",
    "convert your irregular dataset **to a regular dataset** and an **easy origin** is chosen if possible.\n",
    "(The origin is the first timestamp of your dataset.) Converting your dataset to a regular dataset is performed\n",
    "by shifting the timestamp of an observation. For example, if a frequency of 5 minutes is assumed and the observation\n",
    "has a timestamp at 54 minutes and 47 seconds, the timestamp is shifted to 55 minutes. A certain\n",
    "maximal threshold needs to be set to avoid observations being shifted too much. This threshold is\n",
    "called the tolerance and it indicates what the **maximal time-translation** error can be for one\n",
    "observation timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronizing your observations can be performed with the :py:meth:`sync_observations()<metobs_toolkit.dataset.Dataset.sync_observations>`\n",
    "method. As an argument of this function, you must provide a tolerance.\n"
