Edit the code to fulfill the following needs:


/doc Insert docstrings in Numpy style for all classes, methods and functions in this module.
If a docstring is already present, make sure it is in the Numpy style and that the references to the arguments are correct.
Do not include a example in the docstring.
Do not write a Numpy style docstring for dunder-methods or methods decorated as property, but write a single line consice docstring instead.
If a docstring is already present, check if it is still valid and change accordingly.
If a docstring is already present, check for grammer and spelling errors.


Check for typos whenever a new variable is declared, add #TYPO at the end of that line when a typo is detected in the name of the variable.



/edit
Check if type hinting is defined for all methods and functions. Add it if it is missing or wrong.

the log_entry(func) decorator must be added to all functions and methods, add it if it is not present.


Fix the identation of the code if needed.

Rearange the imports to start with python default packages, then dependency packages and lastly  local modules
Check the spelling of inline comments, but do not remove them.
