# =============================================================================
#  Import data
# =============================================================================


# 1. Importing a dataset containing mulitple different stations is a function in the Dataset class. First we need to initiate a Dataset with a name of choise.

sept_2022_all_vlinders = metobs_toolkit.Dataset()
sept_2022_all_vlinders.update_settings(
    input_data_file=testdata_file,  # A demo data file, downloaded with brian tool: https://vlinder.ugent.be/vlinderdata/multiple_vlinders.php
    output_folder="/home/$USER/output/",
)


# ---------------- Importing from CSV file -------------------------------


# The dataset is initiated but still empty. Filling it with the data from a csv file is simply done by:

sept_2022_all_vlinders.import_data_from_file()  # Rember that you added the input file in the settings object, this file will be used.

sept_2022_all_vlinders.coarsen_time_resolution()

# =============================================================================
# Applying quality control
# =============================================================================

#  a number of quality control methods are available in the toolkit. We can classify them in two groups:
# 1) Quality control for missing/duplicated timestamps

# These are automatically performed when the dataset is created

# 2) Quality control for bad observations

# These are not automatically executed. These checks are performd in a sequence
# of specific checks, that are looking for signatures of typically bad observations.
# The following checks are available:
# Gross value check: a threshold check that observations should be between the thresholds
# Persistance check: a check that looks for repetitive observation values (indicating a connection error.)
# Spike check: Check if an observation does not change between two timestamps by more than a threshold.
# Internal consistency check: Check if the temperature observations are physically valid based on relative humidity observations.

# All settings, labels, replacement values are defind in the default settings in /settings_files/qc_settings.py
# To inspect (and change) these quality control settings, you can extract them out of the Settings:


qc_settings = sept_2022_all_vlinders.settings.qc[
    "qc_check_settings"
]  # Settings are stored in nested dictionary
print(qc_settings)

# The settings of the QC checks can be updated using this function:
sept_2022_all_vlinders.update_qc_settings(obstype='temp',
                                          gross_value_max_value=26.3,
                                           persis_time_win_to_check='30T' #30 minutes
                                          )


# Quality control checks are always applied on the full dataset Using the apply_quality_control method on the dataset.

sept_2022_all_vlinders.apply_quality_control(
    obstype="temp",  # which observations to check
    gross_value=True,  # apply gross_value check?
    persistance=True,  # apply persistance check?
    step=True,  # apply the step chec?
    window_variation=True,  # apply internal consistency check?
)

# ----- INTERMEZZO ------
# quality control methods can also be applied on station level. Be aware that the QC labels are an attribute of the station
# and not of the dataset the station belongs to!

station = sept_2022_all_vlinders.get_station("vlinder01")

station.apply_quality_control()

print(station.outliersdf.head())


# =============================================================================
# Quality control values
# =============================================================================

# If an observation is flagged as an outlier by a check, the observational value is replaced.
# By default the outliers are replaced by Nan-values.

# =============================================================================
# Quality control labels
# =============================================================================

# Each check makes a label for each observation. These labels are stored in the dataset.df:

print(sept_2022_all_vlinders.df.head())

# You can see that there is a specific coloumn for each check-label (and for each observationtype that is checked):
print(sept_2022_all_vlinders.df.columns)

# The labels:
#   ok: Observation is not flagged as an outlier
#   not checked: observation could not be checked (mostly because the observations is already flagged as outlier by a previous check)
#   **** outlier: labeld as outlier by the **** check


# After applying the Quality control each observations (that is checked) has a set of qc-labels.
# To create One column with the final label (based on the labels for each check), you can call the
# combine_all_to_obsspace, which will combine observations, outliers gaps and missing timestamps,
# and add a final-qc-label column per obstype:

outliers_sept_2022_all_vlinders = sept_2022_all_vlinders.combine_all_to_obsspace()

print(outliers_sept_2022_all_vlinders["temp_final_label"].head())

# (When writing a dataset to file, there is an attribute 'add_final_labels'. When
#  True, the final labels are computed and added to the file.)

# =============================================================================
# Quality control stats
# =============================================================================

#  Some basic overview statistics are implemented for the quality controll labels.
#  You can extract the frequency statistics by calling:

# obstype: Get statistics of the QC applied on which observationtype
# stationnames: Which subset of the dataset to use? If None, statistics are computed over all the stations,
#               if one stationname is given the stats are computed for that station. You can also give a list of stationnames.
# make_plot:  If True, an overview of pie-charts per check are made.

# The output is a dataframe with frequency statistics per check PRESENTED IN PERSETNTAGES.

qc_statistics = sept_2022_all_vlinders.get_qc_stats(
    obstype="temp",
    stationnames=None,  # or 'station_A' or list of stationnames ['station_A', 'station_B']
    make_plot=True,
)

print(qc_statistics)


# =============================================================================
# Timeseries plots
# =============================================================================

# NOTE: All styling settings are defined in the src/vlinder_toolkit/settings_files/default_formats_settings.py


# To plot timeseries for one station you can use the make_plot function on the station object:
favorite_station = sept_2022_all_vlinders.get_station(stationname="vlinder10")

# Possible obstypes to plot:
# 'temp','radiation_temp','humidity','precip','precip_sum','wind_speed',
# 'wind_gust','wind_direction','pressure','pressure_at_sea_level'

favorite_station.make_plot(
    obstype="temp", title=None
)  # if title=None, a title will be generated

# You can see the effect of the quality control where the values are replaced when the observation was flagged as outlier.
# Since Nan values are not shown in the plotting, the effect of the QC can be seen by missing observations and gaps.


# If you want to compair multiple stations by a timeseries you can use the make_plot function on the dataset:

from datetime import datetime

sept_2022_all_vlinders.make_plot(
    stationnames=["vlinder02", "vlinder05", "vlinder07"],
    obstype="temp",
    starttime=datetime(2022, 9, 4),  # 2022/09/04 00:00:00
    endtime=datetime(2022, 9, 12, 12, 45),  # 2022/09/12 12:45:00
    title=None,
    legend=True,
)
# If you do not specify a start and endtime, all available timestamps are used.
